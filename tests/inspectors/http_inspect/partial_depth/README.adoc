=== HTTP Inspector - Partial depth

The test demonstrates usage of partial_depth parameter
for early detection.

If there is a need to protect a server that evaluates
incomplete HTTP bodies, you can enable early detection
by setting partial_depth parameter to non zero values.
As a result detection will be run on HTTP body fragments.
The price to pay for these extra inspections is higher
CPU utilization and corresponding lower maximal throughput
for a given hardware platform.

In this test the attacker is sending a request with
content-length set to a value higher that the length
of the body hoping that the server will evaluate the
incomplete HTTP body while evading protections that
act only on complete bodies.

HTTP inspector when receives the body fragment, as its
accumulated length is below the limit set by partial_depth,
will immediately flush that data segment through inspection
and detection. This allows any IPS rules to match on any
malicious content in the fragment.

In this test, malware is in packet 5 and it is blocked by
snort.
